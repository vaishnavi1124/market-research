## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:

-   [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vaishnavi1124/market-research.git](https://github.com/vaishnavi1124/market-research.git)
    cd market-research
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install the required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file from the example
    # (You should create a .env.example file first)
    # and add your environment variables like API keys
    # Example .env file:
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"
    # DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd frontend

    # Install the required npm packages
    npm install

    # Create a .env file and add your frontend-specific
    # environment variables.
    # Example .env file:
    # VITE_API_BASE_URL="[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)"
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

You need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /backend directory
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /frontend directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your web browser to use the application.
